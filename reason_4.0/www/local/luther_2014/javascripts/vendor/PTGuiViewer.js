------------------------ USAGE: ------------------------

Quick start: include the following code in the <head> of your HTML file:


<script type="text/javascript" src="PTGuiViewer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var viewer=new PTGuiViewer();
viewer.setSwfUrl("PTGuiViewer.swf");
viewer.preferHtmlViewer();
// or viewer.preferFlashViewer()
viewer.setVars({
  pano: "myimage",
  format: "14faces",
});
viewer.embed("mypanoviewer");
</script>

And in the <body> include:
<div id="mypanoviewer"></div>


The viewer will be embedded as child of the above <div>, and it will use the
images myimage00.jpg ... myimage14.jpg. 

Details:
viewer.setSwfUrl(url)
Point to the location of the accompanying file PTGuiViewer.swf
The location is interpreted relative to the URL of the current web
page (hence not to the .js location).

The PTGui Viewer supports 3 technologies: Flash10, CSS3D and WebGL. 
The Flash10 viewer is available on all browsers with the Flash version 10 plugin
installed. 
CSS3D works (as of feb 2011) on Apple's Safari 5 and IOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod).
WebGL is supported (as of feb 2011) on Chrome 9 and Firefox 4.  

viewer.preferHtmlViewer()
viewer.preferFlashViewer()
These functions determine which technology will be used if the browser supports 
both the native (CSS3D or WebGL) viewer and Flash10. 

viewer.setVars()
Pass an array with the following key/value pairs:
- pano (required): the relative url of the panoramic tiles. The viewer appends
the suffixes 00.jpg through 14.jpg.
- format (required): format of the panoramic tiles. Currently only the '14faces'
format is supported (as produced by PTGui). Future versions of the viewer may
support other formats, therefore this option is required for future 
compatibility.
- pan, tilt, fov: initial viewing parameters. Pan rotates in horizontal direction,
tilt is up/down. Fov is the diagonal field of view angle.
- maxpan, maxtilt, maxfov, minpan, mintilt, minfov: Maximum and minimum limits
for pan/tilt/fov.
- autorotatespeed: speed (in degrees per second) for automatic rotation. If set
to 0, autorotate is disabled. Autorotation starts immediately upon loading the
panorama and ends when the user clicks in the panorama.
- autorotatedelay: If nonzero, autorotation is resumed .. seconds after the user
has released the mouse
- autorotatetohorizon: true or false (default is true)
If true, when autorotation is started the viewer navigates to the horizon. If 
false, the viewer will stay at the current tilt angle when autorotation starts.
- maxiosdimension: Limit the tile size on Apple iOS devices.
If a too large panorama is shown on an iPad/iPhone/iPod, the Safari browser will
crash because it runs out of memory. This setting limits reduces the tile size
on these devices. The recommended (and default) value is 400. 
- showfullscreenbutton_flash: true or false
Sets whether the fullscreen button is visible in the Flash viewer
- showfullscreenbutton_html: true or false
Sets whether the fullscreen button is visible in the HTML viewer
(HTML viewer does not support true full screen viewing due to restrictions in the
HTML standard. Clicking the fullscreen button enlarges the viewer to the full
browser window size.)
- enablegyroscope: true or false
On devices with a gyroscope (iPhone 4 or iPad 2) the viewer can look around in
the panorama by rotating the device. Enabled or disabled by this setting.
- enablemactouchpad: true or false (default is true)
On a mac, enable navigating the panorama by swiping with two fingers on the 
touchpad, or swiping with one finger on the magic mouse. Zooming on a touchpad
is done by clicking with two fingers on the touchpad, holding down and dragging.
With the magic mouse zooming is done by clicking on the right half of the mouse
button, holding down and dragging.
If this is set to false, swiping with two fingers on the touchpad, or swiping with
one finger on the magic mouse, performs zooming.

viewer.setFlashObjectParams()
Allows adding custom parameters for the Flash object/embed tag. For example:
viewer.setFlashObjectParams({
  wmode: "opaque"
});
will add a <param name="wmode" value="opaque"> to the Flash <object> tag
and a parameter in the Flash <embed> tag: <embed ... wmode="opaque" ...>
Only used for the Flash viewer, ignored when using CSS3D or WebGL. 

viewer.embed(container)
Embeds the viewer as a child of the given container. All contents of the 
container element is cleared, and the viewer will make itself a child element
of the container.
The container can be either an html element object (as returned by 
document.getElementById) or a string representing the id of the container
element.
If embed() is called before the page has finished loading, the embedding
will be done as soon as the page has finished loading. So it is safe to call
embed() in a script in the <head> of the HTML page, passing the id of a container 
element that has not yet been created.

viewer.showInLightbox()
Pops up a 'lightbox' (a black window overlaying the entire browser window)
showing the panorama. The user can close the panorama and return to the page by 
pressing the red close button at the top left corner. This method is to be used 
instead of embed(), in response to a user action, for example:
<a href="#" onclick="viewer.showInLightbox(); return false;">view panorama</a>
In Internet Explorer the lightbox is shown correctly only when the page is 
rendered in HTML Strict mode. For compatibility with IE the following line 
should therefore be inserted at the top of the HTML page:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
