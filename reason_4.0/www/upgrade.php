<h1>Upgrading Reason</h1>
<p>Each new version of Reason includes a set of scripts that you should 
run to update your database to work with the latest version of the Reason code base. 
The scripts are designed to be used from one release to the next; you cannot necessarily update 
a Reason database across multiple steps after downloading the most current code base.</p>
<p>If you have trouble upgrading and you are using an old version of Reason, try downloading 
the point release after the one you are currently using and upgrade incrementally.</p>
